.. This is the description of the json files used in the framework


json definition files
=====================

Most of the elements used for the execution of a model in a simulation are defined in a *json* file. The idea behind this choice is to leave the framework flexible for the user to redefine the quantity of objects, initialization, types of agents and spaces that she/he has in a simulation. Allowing reuse of the code base developed for a model.

The json definition file

This file is the file that defines the *simulation model* (the parameters, the schedule type, the agents and the observers) and the *simulation scenarios* (initializations for the agents an space variables for each scenario).

The main structure of the json file is defined in the figure above.

.. code-block:: json

    {
     "simulation_name": "someSimulation",
     "simulation_parameters": [ ],
     "model_name": "someModel",
     "schedule": [ ],
     "spaces": [ ],
     "agents": [ ],
     "observers": [ ],
     "scenarios": [ ]
    }

      
These are the main sections of the json file. Below we make a more detailed description for each part of the file.
